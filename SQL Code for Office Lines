## This is the SQL Code I used to clean and prepare the data about charcter lines in the TV show "The Office." ##

## First I began by ensuring all character names were spelt correctly so I would have accurate data. I sorted through
    all the main characters in each season to correct any mispelling using the following SQL Queries. ##
    

SELECT DISTINCT(Character)
FROM `uplifted-light-375802.The_office.Lines`
Where season = 1
order by Character

SELECT DISTINCT(Character)
FROM `uplifted-light-375802.The_office.Lines`
Where season = 2
order by Character

SELECT DISTINCT(Character)
FROM `uplifted-light-375802.The_office.Lines`
Where season = 3
order by Character

SELECT DISTINCT(Character)
FROM `uplifted-light-375802.The_office.Lines`
Where season = 4
order by Character

SELECT DISTINCT(Character)
FROM `uplifted-light-375802.The_office.Lines`
Where season = 5
order by Character

SELECT DISTINCT(Character)
FROM `uplifted-light-375802.The_office.Lines`
Where season = 6
order by Character

SELECT DISTINCT(Character)
FROM `uplifted-light-375802.The_office.Lines`
Where season = 7
order by Character

SELECT DISTINCT(Character)
FROM `uplifted-light-375802.The_office.Lines`
Where season = 8
order by Character

SELECT DISTINCT(Character)
FROM `uplifted-light-375802.The_office.Lines`
Where season = 9
order by Character


## I sorted through every main character's name as listed in the table and wrote down any typos or mispelled names I could find.
  The next lines of code are what I used to update the incorrect data with the right names for the cast. ##
