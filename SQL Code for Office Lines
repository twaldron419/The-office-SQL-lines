## This is the SQL Code I used to clean and prepare the data about charcter lines in the TV show "The Office." ##

## First I wanted to Delete all rows of data I wouldn't need for my study. I used the following code to keep the characters
    I was focused on for this project. ##
    
DELETE FROM `uplifted-light-375802.The_office.Lines`
WHERE Character != "Pam"
  AND Character !="Michael"
  AND Character != "Jim"
  AND Character != "Dwight"
  AND Character != "Phyllis"
  AND Character != "Stanley"
  AND Character != "Angela"
  AND Character != "Oscar"
  AND Character != "Kevin"
  AND Character != "Meredith"
  AND Character != "Creed"
  AND Character != "Ryan"
  AND Character != "Jan"
  AND Character != "Toby"
  AND Character != "Holly"


## Then I ensured all character names were spelt correctly so I would have accurate data. I sorted through
    all the main characters in each season to correct any mispelling using the following SQL Queries. ##
    

SELECT DISTINCT(Character)
FROM `uplifted-light-375802.The_office.Lines`
Where season = 1
order by Character

SELECT DISTINCT(Character)
FROM `uplifted-light-375802.The_office.Lines`
Where season = 2
order by Character

SELECT DISTINCT(Character)
FROM `uplifted-light-375802.The_office.Lines`
Where season = 3
order by Character

SELECT DISTINCT(Character)
FROM `uplifted-light-375802.The_office.Lines`
Where season = 4
order by Character

SELECT DISTINCT(Character)
FROM `uplifted-light-375802.The_office.Lines`
Where season = 5
order by Character

SELECT DISTINCT(Character)
FROM `uplifted-light-375802.The_office.Lines`
Where season = 6
order by Character

SELECT DISTINCT(Character)
FROM `uplifted-light-375802.The_office.Lines`
Where season = 7
order by Character

SELECT DISTINCT(Character)
FROM `uplifted-light-375802.The_office.Lines`
Where season = 8
order by Character

SELECT DISTINCT(Character)
FROM `uplifted-light-375802.The_office.Lines`
Where season = 9
order by Character


## I sorted through every main character's name as listed in the table and wrote down any typos or mispelled names I could find.
  The next lines of code are what I used to update the incorrect data with the right names for the cast. ##


UPDATE `uplifted-light-375802.The_office.Lines` 
SET Character="Angela"
WHERE Character="Angels"

UPDATE `uplifted-light-375802.The_office.Lines` 
SET Character="Angela"
WHERE Character="Anglea"

UPDATE `uplifted-light-375802.The_office.Lines` 
SET Character="Angela"
WHERE Character="Angel"

UPDATE `uplifted-light-375802.The_office.Lines` 
SET Character="Michael"
WHERE Character="Micael"

UPDATE `uplifted-light-375802.The_office.Lines` 
SET Character="Michael"
WHERE Character="micael"

UPDATE `uplifted-light-375802.The_office.Lines` 
SET Character="Michael"
WHERE Character="Micahel"

UPDATE `uplifted-light-375802.The_office.Lines` 
SET Character="Michael"
WHERE Character="micahel"

UPDATE `uplifted-light-375802.The_office.Lines` 
SET Character="Michael"
WHERE Character="Michae"

UPDATE `uplifted-light-375802.The_office.Lines` 
SET Character="Michael"
WHERE Character="Michal"

UPDATE `uplifted-light-375802.The_office.Lines` 
SET Character="Michael"
WHERE Character="Micheal"

UPDATE `uplifted-light-375802.The_office.Lines` 
SET Character="Michael"
WHERE Character="Mihael"

UPDATE `uplifted-light-375802.The_office.Lines` 
SET Character="Darryl"
WHERE Character="Daryl"

UPDATE `uplifted-light-375802.The_office.Lines` 
SET Character="Darryl"
WHERE Character="Darrly"

UPDATE `uplifted-light-375802.The_office.Lines` 
SET Character="Dwight"
WHERE Character="Dight"

UPDATE `uplifted-light-375802.The_office.Lines` 
SET Character="Meredith"
WHERE Character="Meridith"

UPDATE `uplifted-light-375802.The_office.Lines` 
SET Character="Phyllis"
WHERE Character="Phyliss"

## Next I renamed a column name that had no context to one that made sense for the table ##

ALTER TABLE `uplifted-light-375802.The_office.Lines`
RENAME COLUMN int64_field_0 to Order_of_Lines;

## This concludes my SQL code. Now I have verified all character names are correct and we only have data on the 
    Characters included in my study. ##
